## Project Description and Evaluation
The project consisted of two homeworks. For each one, a dataset was given and an appropriate neural network architecture had to be designed and trained using TensorFlow. Evaluation was based on a written report and the results obtained with respect to other teams.

### Homework 1

In this homework, we were asked to classify plants that are divided into two categories according to their state of health. 
It is a binary classification problem, so the goal is to predict the correct class label in {0, 1}. The evaluation metric is *accuracy*.

**Evaluation**: 5/5 + 0.5 bonus points to recognize exceptional work

### Homework 2

In this homework, we were asked to predict future samples of the input time series. 
The goal is to design and implement forecasting models to learn how to exploit past observations in the input sequences to correctly predict the future. The task is to develop a forecasting model that is able to predict several uncorrelated time series. The prerequisite is that the model exhibits generalisation capabilities in the forecasting domain, allowing it to transcend the constraints of specific time domains. This requires a model that, while specialised in forecasting, is not limited to predicting in a single or predefined time context. The evaluation metric is *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*.
